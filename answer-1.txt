Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project.

My proudest professional achievement is a project management system.
It is similar to Trello, or Jira, or Azure Dashboard.
It was a startup project and I worked on this project from scratch.
This system helps users to create tickets, assign them to others, ask for the results, etc.
It also has its own bot that reminds ticket status to the users so that helps them to complete their tickets in a timely manner and suggest insane tickets first.
And users can have real-time communication if needed.

On this project, my role as a full-stack developer and I have used React, React Hooks, Redux, Storybook, Semantic UI, CSS, LESS for front-end development.
For the back-end, I have built serverless applications using AWS(Amplify, API gateway, Cognito, Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, S3, Cloud Watch, EC2, etc).
I implemented CI/CD pipelines through Azure DevOps and used Git for code versioning.
